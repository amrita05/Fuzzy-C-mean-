# Fuzzy-C-mean-
GUI MATLAB file for fuzzy C mean classification on image/imagery.

Fuzzy clustering (is like simple plain k-mean) is a clustering method in which each data point may or my not be lies in more than one cluster.
Clustering involve implications of data points to clusters for example items in the same cluster will be same to each other, while items belonging to different clusters will be different from each other.
Clusters are identified on the basis of similarity. These similarity features can be distance, connectivity, and intensity. 
Different similarity features can be chosen based on the data or the application. . 
This file aims towards a clustering algorithm which tells about Fuzzy C-means clustering along with Markov random field (FCM). 
The density function of the 1st principal component(PC) which majorly tells about the class differences and is applied in estimating of initial specified labels for FCM algorithm.
Thus, the sensitivity to the random initial specified values can be ignored.
At the same time, this algorithm takes into account the spatial correlation info. of pixels. 
The experiments on the synthetic and QuickBird images show that the proposed method can achieve better classification accuracy and visual qualities than the general FCM algorithm.
